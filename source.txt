		'I serve tea and answer questions, madam.'
		
		'You’re not doing either of those. Well, maybe the second one, but not very well.'
		
		'Shall I bring you some tea?'
		
		'Sure, it’s a little bit cold in here anyways.'
		
		Rubbing your shoulders, you glance away and glance back. He reappears with a cart of tea and sweets.
		
		'Holy sh-'
		
		'Madam, I ask that you refrain from swearing, it’s unbecoming.'
		
		You glare at him, and grab the cup he’s pouring.

		'Really? Ok. Wow you actually answered me. But, what an odd name.'
		
		Curious, you take a second to think more about the name, wondering if you can learn more about yourself as you spell it out in your head. Suddenly, something clicks.
		
		'Wow, bite me. That’s an anagram for 'no name'.'
		
		He looked away before you finished speaking.
